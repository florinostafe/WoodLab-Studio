          question: "What types of reclaimed materials do you use?",
          answer:
            "We work with a variety of reclaimed materials including old barn wood, shipping pallets, vintage bike frames, antique doors, industrial metal pieces, and salvaged furniture components. Each piece is carefully selected for quality and character. We source materials from local demolition sites, old buildings, and partner with other craftspeople to ensure nothing goes to waste.",

          question: "How do you ensure the quality and safety of reclaimed materials?",
          answer:
            "All reclaimed materials undergo thorough inspection and treatment. We check for structural integrity, remove any harmful substances, sand and clean surfaces, and apply appropriate treatments for durability. Wood is tested for moisture content and treated for pests if necessary. Metal components are checked for rust and structural soundness before use.",

Medium complexity items (dining tables, custom chairs) take 4-8 weeks. Complex or large pieces can take 8-12 weeks. We'll provide a detailed timeline during consultation and keep you updated throughout the process.",

          question: "Can you work with materials I provide?",
          answer:
            "We love working with materials that have personal significance to our clients. Whether it's wood from a family property, metal from a meaningful object, or other materials with sentimental value, we can incorporate them into your custom piece. We'll assess the materials and discuss how to best integrate them into the design.",
